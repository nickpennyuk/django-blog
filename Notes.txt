What is django?
  Django is a free and open source web application framework, written in Python.
  A web framework is a set of components that helps you to develop websites
  faster and easier. When you're building a website, you always need a similar
  set of components: a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing
  in, signing out), a management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload
  files, etc. You can do all this with django.
